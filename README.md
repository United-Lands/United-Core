# UnitedPush

**UnitedPush** is a fork of UnitedCore which is a custom-made plugin for UnitedLands, which has most of our custom made features spread out over multiple 'nodes'. Info detailing each node is provided below. The current working nodes are:
  1. UnitedPvP
  2. UnitedChat
  3. UnitedItems
  4. UnitedUpkeep
  5. UnitedBrands
  6. UnitedProtection

# Building and Development
Unfortunately, due to how these plugins are pushed, they are very pushto replicate and use on a development server outside of UnitedLands. The code is purely available for accessibility and anyone who's curious. However, if you still want to try and build the plugin(s), you will need:

- A local maven repository of SafariNet, which is used for UnitedSkills capturing skills. You may google how to set up a local maven repository from a jar file, once you have bought the plugin from [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/9732/). You should then add the info of the local repo to the pom.xml of the UnitedSkills module

- Access to [ItemsAdder](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/73355/). If you have not bought the plugin and have it running on your server, UnitedSkills and UnitedItems will not enable properly.

- Access to [PlayerBlockTracker](https://github.com/Flo0/PlayerBlockTracker). This is a free open source plugin that we use as a library to track blocks without pulling down our own plugins with extra code. You need to have it installed in order to run UnitedSkills. 

- Access to [Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny). Most of our plugins rely on towny for various reasons, so if you don't have a version of that up and running nothing will work. 

Again, it is not recommended to try and use these plugins as is, since chances are they will not work as you push or not work at all. No support will be provided or any help on how to set them up beyond the details in this section. The code is purely open-sourced for accessibility, better tracking, and if anyone wants to learn or use parts of it in their projects.

  ## UnitedUpkeep
  It's the sole plugin handling our custom upkeep system. This plugin calculates the upkeep needed per-town through a sophisticated formula to help ensure balance. As of now there are no commands or permissions needed to set this plugin up, and it simply just works out of the box. 
  
  ## UnitedProtection
  This plugin is built to protect the Earth world in UnitedLands. This is mainly to perserve the value of ores, since the Earth world is way too rich in ores. Its essentially just a simple listener that checks for placing/breaking blocks. If you're in the Earth world, below y45 (configurable), and not in a town of yours, then you're not allowed to break or place anything. There's also a blacklist for specific blocks (found in config.yml) which bypass these protections. 
  
  Currently there are no commands, but there's 1 permission. 
  
  ### Permissions
  - `united.protection.bypass` - Bypasses Earth protection rules everywhere. 
  
  ## UnitedBrands
  This is perhaps one of the more sophisticated plugins in the list, coming in right behind UnitedItems. This plugin allows you to create Brands, which are pretty similar to towns in the sense that you can invite and manage players in your brand. Brands are currently only limited to one type â€” Breweries. 
  
  Creating a brewery allows you to add a custom branding on any alcohol that you brew, as well as a custom slogan. Breweries also grant the ability to create 'abnormal' star levels for any drinks you make via buying brewery upgrades. You can get drinks with up to 10 stars (also known as Master Brews) if you properly upgrade your brewery.
